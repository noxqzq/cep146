## Question 1

Since it has 14 phys. cores and 20 logical processors due to Hyper-Threading  it means that theoretically the CPU can handle 20 

## Question 2

My  primary storage is SSD it is an NVMe WD PC SN560 it is a 1 TB SSD meaning it is faster than HDD. Instant boot times, faster app loading, less latency and better multitasking capabilities.

## Question 3

I have 16 GB of DDR5 RAM at this day and age the minimum requirement of RAM for basic use of a computer is 8 GB so 16 GB is counted as the sweet spot since it is enough to do some high resource draining tasks and run smoothly while doing day to day tasks.
